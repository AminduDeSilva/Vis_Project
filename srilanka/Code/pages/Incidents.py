# Status Quo in Sri Lanka section
st.header("Status Quo in Sri Lanka", anchor=sl_events[2000]["Id"])
st.markdown("""
In 2000, Sri Lanka's socio-economic situation was shaped by a mix of challenges and developments:

**Civil War Impact:** The country was in the midst of a prolonged civil war between the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This conflict had significant economic and social repercussions, including reduced foreign investment, limited economic growth, and high defense spending.

**Economic Growth:** Despite the conflict, Sri Lanka maintained modest economic growth, driven by sectors like tea exports, textiles, and remittances from overseas workers. However, poverty and inequality remained significant issues, particularly in rural and war-affected areas.

**Global Relationships:** Sri Lanka's economy was reliant on global trade, with exports such as tea, rubber, and garments being crucial. Economic ties with countries like the United States, Europe, and neighboring India were essential.

**Political Climate:** The political landscape was polarized, with frequent changes in government and challenges in addressing corruption and governance. Efforts to negotiate peace with the LTTE often stalled, prolonging instability.

In summary, Sri Lanka in 2000 was a nation with significant potential but was constrained by conflict, socio-economic inequality, and political instability.

- In 2022, mass demonstrations erupted due to severe shortages of essential goods and skyrocketing inflation.

# Today Section

st.markdown("""
In 2025, Sri Lanka's socio-economic situation reflects a nation in recovery and transition:

**Economic Stabilization and Growth:** Following a severe economic downturn in 2022, Sri Lanka's economy has shown signs of stabilization.
The World Bank projects a growth rate of 4.4% for 2024, indicating a positive trajectory. This recovery is supported by declining inflation
and a current account surplus, bolstered by increased remittances and a rebound in tourism.

**Poverty and Inequality:** Despite economic improvements, poverty levels remain elevated. As of mid-2024, approximately 24.8% of the population
lived below the poverty line, highlighting ongoing challenges in income inequality and labor market disparities.

**Political Developments:** In September 2024, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a Marxist lawmaker, was elected president, reflecting a public desire for
change from traditional political elites. His administration faces the task of implementing economic reforms and managing international relationships
to support the nation's recovery.

**International Support and Debt Restructuring:** Sri Lanka continues to engage with international partners for financial assistance. China has expressed
commitment to aiding Sri Lanka in achieving financial relief and debt sustainability. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the third review
of Sri Lanka's $2.9 billion bailout, emphasizing the need for continued reforms and debt restructuring.

**Social Initiatives:** The government has launched programs aimed at socio-economic transformation, such as the 'Clean Sri Lanka' initiative, which focuses
on political, social, and economic reforms to foster long-term development.

In summary, Sri Lanka in 2025 is navigating a path toward economic recovery and social reform, addressing persistent challenges while leveraging international
partnerships and domestic initiatives to build a more resilient future.
