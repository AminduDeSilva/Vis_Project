    "inflation": "We can observe how various incidents over the years have impacted inflation. Sri Lanka has faced significant inflationary pressure in recent years, particularly after the economic crisis in 2022, which caused a massive spike of almost 50%. Inflation has since been moderated due to stabilization efforts by the government and support from international organizations like the IMF. However, an inflation rate of around 2% is believed to be healthy or beneficial to the economy in the long term.",
    "GDP": "The GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is often used to measure the economic health of a country or region. The service sector, including tourism, IT and financial services, contributes the largest share, followed by manufacturing and agriculture. In 2023, Sri Lanka's GDP was approximately 83 billion US dollars, which is around 3800 US dollars per capita. However, economic disparities persist across regions.",
    "happiness": "This chart compares reported happiness in Sri Lanka and Germany, based on a survey of over 1,000 citizens in each country who ranked various aspects of life on a 0-10 scale. Factors like strong family ties, rich spiritual tradition, and community contribute to happiness, while economic hardship, instability, and regional disparities detract from well-being. Note that the global ranks remained mostly stable.",
    "tourism": "Tourism is a vital sector for Sri Lanka, accounting for around 12% of the GDP at its peak before the COVID-19 pandemic. Both Sri Lanka and Germany have seen a significant decline in tourism due to the pandemic, with the sector also being impacted in Sri Lanka by the Easter bombing and economic crisis. While Germany receives a higher number of tourist visits, tourism accounts for a smaller share of its GDP, at around 5.5% in 2019, compared to Sri Lanka's pre-pandemic peak."
