We are using a combination of line charts and bar charts. First the line charts show trends in the Sri Lankan data and highlight important changes.

This diagram has five distinct vertical areas. You can only see two vertical line charts because I didn't feel like drawing more. They start at the top and go downwards, and have individual y-axes. Our chosen marks here are points or rings, and the information channels are the positions of the points as well as the color of certain sections. You can see how the colorful sections align with each other and that red is bad while green is good.

On the left is a slider, which determines what data is visible or not. We can use this to slowly reveal new data points when telling our story. After passing major events, a brief text will appear as reference.

On another panel we want to allow the user to deep-dive into the data we just presented. On the surface we have the same data as before but rotated. However, the user can now hover over single data points to reveal more detailed information. This could be something like it's composition, sub-categories or related data.

Finally to compare the Sri Lankan data with Germany, we want to have the same four categories as before but with bar charts instead of line charts. The marks would be the bars and for information channels we use the position and size of the bars to convey the values. Additionally, we can color-code them to make it easy to identify Sri Lanka and Germany. It would be possible to combine these with the second set of charts but let's see.
